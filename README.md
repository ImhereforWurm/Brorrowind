# Brorrowind
An annon built and tested mod for Wurm Unlimited, inspired by Morrowind.

## Overview
**Warning: requires wyvrnmods as a dependancy**

This mod was built to add a few key features I wanted to add to the bi annual Wurm server hosted for anons. A combination of cosmetic and practical features, I've added toggles for everything in the *.config.

## Features
-**Brewmaster Spice:** Item crafted with herbs, one time use for instantly finishing fermentation. Also provides a +10ql boost.

-**Shard of Lorkhan:** Non crafted, intended as a reward from chests or events. Grants the user +1.0 to all characteristics.

-**Mass Restriction Action:** GMs (power 5 only) can now use the #addprotections and #removeprotections commands to mass add/remove all restrictions to every tile, fence, and structure within a set radius. Now you can quickly set up an event area without having to worry about deeds!
*example: '#protectfromplayers 3' will add restrictions to everything in a 3 tile radius. '#removeprotection 0 will remove restrictions from everything in the tile you are standing on.*

-**Racial Masks:** Masks designed to look like Khajiit, Dunmer, and other races of Morrowind. Give your players that fresh off the boat experience.

-**Custom Emotes/Sounds:** Includes a new action for all players to shout the classic "You N'wah!". Also includes a bonus emote for GMs to use with their wands.

-**Decorative Items:** Non craftable decoration items for GMs to place, such as dwemer scraps, a currious puzzle box, and a tapestry of the most handsome game developer ever.

-**Facade Items:** A series of decorative items designed to look like buildings, some of which are sized to allow building rooms inside. Recreate Vivec with the high fane and cantons, or Seyda Neen with the Census and Excise office.

-**New Weapons:** Fully configurable with toggles for player crafting. Add Dwemer, Glass, and Daedric weapons to your server!
*note: Daedric weapons currently require 100 souls from soulstealing to craft, and defaults in properties provide a +1/+2 damage bonus for one and two handed weapons.*

# Special Thanks
First and foremost, a huge thanks to every anon that has ever touched any of the servers in our long history. I never would have gotten this far if it weren't for a fateful cart tour of decimated villages years ago. Thank you all, you are blessed and have blessed me.
Special shoutouts to Nuggro, the greatest admin and event coordinator, Tarz for always being there even when I wasn't, and Morarn for always having my back with technical problems.

Next, this mod would never have existed without Tyodas great modding tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8fNV9R1LS8), as well as his *.wom exporter tool for blender (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSr6vWAr9DA).

And finally, a huge thanks to everyone in the modding community for answering my silly questions and providing feedback.
